# CP32: Sign Detection with Tensorflow
- Date: Semester 2, 2020
- Course: COMP3988 (Capstone Projects Project)
- Team ID: CP32-17B1
- Tutor: Frank Fu

## Project Introduction
> Moving closer to Autonomous Cars using AI and ML tech.

In this project, we will implement both a real word and simulated world traffic sign detection algorithms using Neural Network (TensorFlow).
- The simulated data will be collect using Donkey Car simulator. And there is another team focus on simulator improvements.
- We will look at different algorithms to come up with robust and efficient solution.



### High-Level Scope summary
- Milestone 1 (Week 6): TensorFlow minor sign detection (stop, turning, parking, traffic lights) using simulated data.
- Milestone 2 (Week 9): TensorFlow major detection
- Milestone 3 (Week 13): Completed solution with Demo and Documentation
